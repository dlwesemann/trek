  "content": "The COA Product is not a cost accounting system.  While costing is a key part of the product definition, it is not “the product definition” but rather something that is embedded in more overarching goals such as the analytics that measure patient value, initiatives that improve efficiencies, and reports that gauge patient satisfaction, outcomes, and the quality of care.
