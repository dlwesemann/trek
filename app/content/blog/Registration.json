  "content": "Even though there is significant demand for measuring and assessing the true cost realities of delivering health care, the wholly grail of health care analytics is the ability to assess true costs in relation to the quality, outcome, and satisfaction of the patientâ€™s care.

The need to have this deeper discussion to merely convey product value is a sign that the value proposition is missing the mark and would impede product adoption. As such, assessing quality, outcome, and patient satisfaction measure in conjunction with cost measures and using this information to help drive health care transformation is critical to a truly compelling and differentiated product.
