  "content": "SDI Analytics is dedicated to transparency in medicine driving improved outcomes and cost by developing technology to help health care professionals (providers, to managers, analysts, and executives) understand and drive patient value.  SDI's highly advanced technology is called Cost and Outcomes Analitics, or COA, and provides health care professionals with a patient centered view of true costs on the clinical condition level, over the cycle of care and correlates them to patient outcome, quality and satisfaction measures.  SDI does not focus on cost accounting. True cost awareness however is fundamental to assessing patient value and driving healthcare transformation and as such, is embedded in a larger, more overarching value proposition. The key differentiator, among many, of SDI's technology is the complete cycle of delivering information that drives initiatives, which are tracked and proven to drive incremental improvements in quality, outcomes, cost and revenue."
